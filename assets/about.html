          <span class="descr_assoc">
            <b>Mother and Child health care Association</b> is a Cameroon
            based charity organization, dedicated to standing up for
            families especially within the reproductive age, and children
            under the age of five years. With live experience, we advocate
            for the rights of every pregnant woman and children for proper
            health care and the right to live. We are particularly
            implicated in the prevention of mother to child transmission of
            HIV (PMCT), the prevention, and reduction of malnutrition in
            pregnant women and children under 5 years. <br /><br />
            We raise and grant funds and deliver a wide range of high-impact
            programs and services in partnership with health institutions
            around the country. We are mostly work with those in the suburbs
            where public health has no influence or presence and the people
            have no access to health care. We provide assistance to pregnant
            women and children living in remote areas of the country;
            Deprived, Excluded and Vulnerable to health hazards that would
            otherwise have been prevented.
            <br /><br />
            MOCHCA also works together with organizations giving
            psychological relieve to war victims, those women and children
            who have experienced rape, and all sexual violence especially
            those who get pregnant by this process, we provide support for
            their health care and help them overcome the trauma, break the
            cycle and gain strength and resilience to survive.

          Founded by Madam Bezejuh Emmerencia in 2017. MOCHCA’s primary
          vision is to reduce maternal, Neonatal and child mortality as much
          as possible through provision of proper assistance for appropriate
          health care. Pregnant woman and children below the age of 5 who
          constitute the vulnerable groups in the underdeveloped society
          particularly have many times been subject to become victims of
          circumstances leading to their death either because they are poor
          and so cannot access good health care, are malnourished, or are
          ignorant of the importance of preventive health measures. Our goal
          is to ensure that every woman of child bearing age, particularly
          the pregnant women and mothers of children under five years
          understand the importance and be able to access proper antenatal
          care, child health care services, are well fed to prevent
